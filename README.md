# Drone-Insurance-App


## Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions up to the "Creating a new application" step before proceeding.

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

Before running the app, you need to install the required dependencies. Run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm install

# OR using Yarn
yarn install
```

### Step 2: Start the Metro Server

Next, start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

### Step 3: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal and run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

#### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

#### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly, provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.
